## About this site

  This site is the result of a newbie data scientist trying to make her free time productive. The main content of the site is basic data set analyses (mostly using sets from Kaggle and .gov databases) using the programming language R. The author will also frequently use the site to reflect on medical school preparation (hence the "Med" in StatsMed Sheep) and life philosophy (kinda). Posts will be every ~2 weeks, or whenever she's able to take a break from the grind.

## About the Author

  Hi, I'm Clara. I'm a first year undergraduate student attending Smith College who's planning on majoring in SDS, or Statistical and Data Sciences for you non-Smithies. I'm also a premed student. So, I like studying how relationships between multiple variables can be modeled, especially in the realm of health. This site will probably feature analyses of all kinds of sets, however. In my free time aside from StatsMed Sheep, I like to watch kdramas, horror films, and the premed rite of passage TV show House MD. I also enjoy reading science fiction and English literature. To get swole I like to dance, run, and attend weekly Zumba sessions with my friends. Lastly, as you might've guessed, I like fluffy things.
